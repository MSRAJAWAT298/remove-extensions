 How to remove .php, .html, .htm extensions with .htaccess
 I recently wanted to remove the extensions from my website, in order to make the URLs more user and search engine friendly. I stumbled across tutorials on how to remove the .php extension from a PHP page. What about the .html? I wanted to remove those as well! In this tutorial Iâ€™ll show you how to do that easily, by editing the .htaccess file.
If you have not .htaccess file then create own .htaccess file with name .htaccess and  extention .conf
