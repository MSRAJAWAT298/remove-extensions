Removing Extensions
To remove the .php extension from a PHP file for example yoursite.com/demopage.php to yoursite.com/demopage you have to add the following code inside the .htaccess file:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L]

If you want to remove the .html extension from a html file for example yoursite.com/wallpaper.html to yoursite.com/wallpaper you simply have to change the last line from the code above, to match the filename:
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.html [NC,L]

RewriteEngine On
# NC makes the rule non case sensitive
# L makes this the last rule that this specific condition will match
# $ in the regular expression makes the matching stop

# Rewrite for hotel_details.php/?id=3
RewriteRule hotel_details/([0-9a-zA-Z]+)$ hotel_details.php?id=$1 [NC,L]
# Rewrite for search_hotel.php
RewriteRule search_hotel search_hotel.php [NC,L]

# for admin pages.......
# Rewrite for admin/index.php
# RewriteRule admin/([0-9a-zA-Z]+)$ admin/index.php [NC,L]

# Rewrite for admin/dasboard.php
